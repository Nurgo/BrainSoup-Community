This is a simple example of how you can use a custom tool to add code execution
capability to your agents. The script to be executed is passed to the Python
interpreter via an environment variable.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
A Python interpreter must be installed on your computer.

WARNING:
The code interpreter is not sandboxed, and the agent can potentially
damage your system. Use this tool at your own risk.
